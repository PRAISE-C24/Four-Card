# What I learned
I learned how to make the web resposive.

And I also learned how flexible it is to span columns and rows;
 to fit in to a desired layer using the Css Grid system.

my css magic code!
```css
@media screen and (min-width:900px){
    .box{
        width: 80%;
    }
    .box-1{
        grid-row: 2/4;
        grid-column: 1/2;
    }
       
    .box-2{
        grid-column-start: 2;
        grid-row: 1/3;
    }
    .box-3 {
        grid-row: 3/5;
        grid-column:2/3;
    }
    .box-4 {
        grid-row: 2/4;
        grid-column:3/4 ;
    }
}
```
